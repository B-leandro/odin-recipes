        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Invention of the french chef Lagran Jacque Lassen in 1515, Lasagne quickly became the favorite plate of every french but, in
            1518 it was exchanged for the "Mona Lisa" painting (in italian "Monna Lisa", small things make differences, don't ask why) and
            Lasagne was banned from France. Poor Lassen!
